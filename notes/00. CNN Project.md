## Problem
---
Binary classification neurological data into 'healthy' and 'diseased'.


## Data
---
Data obtained from [[Link later]]

Because Convolutional Networks are best for processing and classifying image data, we choose data that contain only images.

There are two possibilities for our data:

- Using fMRI data
- Using other data when no fMRI data is easily accessible (having to request access from site admin)

## Solution
---
We use a [[11. Convolutional Neural Networks|convolutional neural net]] to perform binary classification on the data set. Thus our loss function is a **0/1 loss**.

For reference, the *objective* is to try to minimize this function:
$$
\DeclareMathOperator*{\min}{min}
\min_{w, b}\sum_n \boldsymbol{\underbrace{L}_{\mbox{0/1 loss}}}\cdot\left[\boldsymbol{f_{CNN}}>0\right] + \underbrace{\lambda\cdot R(w, b)}_{\mbox{hyperparameter }\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mbox{ regularizer}}
$$

Since ours is a binary classification problem, we will use *logistic regression*. We will surrogate the **0/1 loss** function with a logistic loss function:
$$
\boldsymbol{L}^{logit}(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{log2}log(1+\exp[-y\hat{y}])
$$
