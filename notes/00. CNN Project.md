## I. Problem
---
We want to classify some dataset of neurological images into some binary conclusion, for example either 'healthy' or 'diseased'.


## II. Data
---
Data obtained from [[Link later]].

Because Convolutional Networks are best for processing and classifying image data, we choose data that contain only images.

There are two possibilities for our data:

- Using fMRI data
- Using other data when no fMRI data is easily accessible (having to request access from site admin)

## III. Solution
---
We use a [[11. Convolutional Neural Networks|convolutional neural network]] to perform binary classification on the data set. Thus our loss function is a **0/1 loss**.

For reference, the *objective* is to try to minimize this function:
$$
\DeclareMathOperator*{\min}{min}
\min_{w, b}\sum_n \boldsymbol{\underbrace{L}_{\mbox{0/1 loss}}}\cdot\underbrace{\left[\boldsymbol{f_{CNN}}>0\right]}_{\mbox{activation}} + \underbrace{\lambda\cdot R(w, b)}_{\mbox{hyperparameter }\boldsymbol{\cdot}\mbox{ regularizer}}
$$


#### 1. Loss Function

Since ours is a binary classification problem, we will use *logistic regression*. We will surrogate the **0/1 loss** function with a logistic loss function:
$$
\boldsymbol{L}^{logit}(y, \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{log2}log(1+\exp[-y\hat{y}])
$$

#### 2. Activation/Link function

Because our project use a neural network we use a sigmoid function, the **hyperbolic tangent**, as our activation/link function:

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{y}&=\sum v_i\cdot\tanh(w_i, \boldsymbol{\hat{x}})\cr
&=\boldsymbol{v}\cdot \tanh(\boldsymbol{W\cdot\hat{x}})
\end{align}
$$


#### 3. Weight regularization

Because ours is a neural network, we use back-propagation to regularize the weight vector.
