## What is Machine Learning?

- A computer program that improves its performance at some task through experience.

**Keywords:** Autonomy, adaptability, efficiency

## Subfields of ML

1. Supervised Learning
    - Decision Tree

2. Unsupervised Learning

3. Reinforcement Learning

## Decision Tree

How do we *supervise* the algorithm?  What does it mean to *supervise*?  Supervision here means we provide a set of examples and the algorithm will use this set to produce predictions.

First, we need to describe the *features*/attributes of the data set, i.e. *data representation*.  In the case of CSV format, the *feature values* are represented in comma-separated values.

**Note:** the concept of *noise* will be discussed more in the future.  In brief, noise could appear as inaccurate labeling of data, for example.

## The Induction Framework

1. Traning Data
2. Learning Algorithm
3. f
4. Test Example

```tex
    1 -> 2 -> 3 <-> 4 -> 3
    
    f(x) -> y
        where
            x: examples
            y: label
```

## Types of Inductive Learning

1. Regression
2. Binary classif.
3. Multiclass classsif.
4. Discovery
5. Reinforcement learning

*We focus on 1-4 for now.*

```tex
    f(x) => $R^+$

    f(x) => {0, 1} {+, -}

    f(x) => { NYC, SF, Pullman, CA }
```
## Prediction Accuracy

```tex
    Accuracy  = \frac {#correct}{#total}
```

## Performance: Loss Function

- `L(., .)`
    ```tex
    L(y, $y^$)
        where
            y  = true label
            $y^$ = 
    ```
