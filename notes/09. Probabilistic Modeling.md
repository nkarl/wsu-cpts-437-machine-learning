### Probability Rules
- **random variables**
- **sum-to-one**
- **marginalization**
- **chain rule**
- **Bayes rule**


## 2. Statistic estimation

	- Lagrangian

#### Naive Bayes models
- chain rule
- naive Bayes assumption 
- Bernouilli distribution
- discrete distribution
- Gaussian/Normal distribution (continuous)

#### Prediction & logistic regression
**log-likelihood** is the *negative form of the [[07. Linear Models and Optimization#^404f78|logistic loss for linear models]].*
