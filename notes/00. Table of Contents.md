## 3. Geometric Learning & Nearest Neighbors
This class of problems involves boundary establishment, or classifying data points into differentiated groups and in turn drawing the boundaries between them.

- Data $\to$ Feature Vectors
- KNN
- Decision Bounds
- K-Mean Clustering
- Curse of High Dimensionality

## 4. Perceptron
1. Perceptron follows the *error-driven updating* model.

2. There is still the need for *geometric interpretation*, i.e. the same problem encountered by the KNN and clustering methods.

3. Interpreting perceptron *weights*.

4. *Convergence* and *Linear Separability*
