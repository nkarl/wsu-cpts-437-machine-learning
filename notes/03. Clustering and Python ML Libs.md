## 1. K-Mean Clustering
---
- *Unsupervised Learning*
- Data is examples of $\{x_1 .. x_N\}$, i.e. we assume it is structured and the vectors have the same dimensionality

**NOTE:** *Add a description of the algorithm here for future reference.*

#### Will K-means converge (stop changing)?
Yes:
	1. Cluster assignment
	2. Mean computation

Because both tasks use the same distance function. There is only finite numbers of assignments.

#### K-means Hyperparameters
- K
	- Choose using *elbow method*

We can also use Sum of squared error, SSE.

```txt
SSE = 0

for c:cluster in clusters:
	mean = clusterMean(c)
	for d:datapoint in c:
		SSE += (d - mean) ** 2
```


## 2. Curse of High Dimensionality
---
increase in dimensionality causes a sharp increase in computational complexity.
